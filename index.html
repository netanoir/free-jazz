                what if it turns out free jazz isn't a thing, but instead
                is a way? (isn't a way also just a thing?)
                free jazz isn't a "thing" that can be thingified 
                into an object. free jazz is a "we."
                we're simply on the way. not from something 
                or  to something, but perhaps to engage 
                in the making of something.

                any (free) (jazz) band larger than a quintet is dangerous.
                once a band gets too large you approach big band territory.
                when a thing scales, its capacity to fuck things up
                increases. scale is necessary for ideological success
                from capitalism to communism, however, as a thing scales,
                it strays further away from its original intentions.
                how do you remedy scale? how to you maintain understanding
                and empathy? proximity, closeness, entanglement.
                free jazz is a music of proximity, overlap, crowdedness,
                rubbing, density.

                free jazz is to curate, meaning to serve, which is to care.
                free jazz is taking care. this is not to be confused with art
                curation, which is evil. free jazz is a social practice.
                there is no rhythm section in free jazz—all players play
                all parts at the same time without giving into 
                individualization. free jazz is Black music. it came from
                not only a brilliant and talented class of people, but also
                a deeply traumatized people who hacked together a music and sociality
                which turned shit into something good. 
                free jazz is the shit.
                free jazz is the psychological grounding wire for those
                borne into social death. free jazz is ecstasy, that is, to be 
                up or out of state or to take flight. free jazz is simaltaneously
                heaven and hell—or perhaps, the after life.
                the operationalization of a kind of magic or 
                mysticism which is truly random. free jazz is a conduit
                through which we can experience the divine.
